## Introduction

A full-stack poetry blog site that helps poets write their next masterpiece. Pluma provides easily accessible writing tools, allows users to publish their work, and fosters a community of writers online.

### Project Specification

This is Portfolio Project 2 of General Assembly Web Development Immersive. The goal is to create a Full-Stack Web App of our chosing. The database is created using PostgreSQL and Sequelize. The back-end of the site was implemented using Node.js and Express and data is communicated using EJS. Data in the front-end are queried from DataMuse API using Fetch.

### Technical Requirements
- Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) -- ideally a user model and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
- Include sign up/log in functionality, with hashed passwords & an authorization flow
- Incorporate at least one API. Examples include Yelp, Tumblr, Facebook, and others on Mashape.
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
- Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data
- Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
- Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public

## Building the App

<!-- I started by creating the model diagrams. I designed a few models and kept it simple and straightforward. -->

### Models and Entity Relations

### Future Implementation

One writing tool that I intend to add is a D3 visualization for trigger words. The idea is to have a user input a word (trigger), and the writing tool will display nodes of words related to it, their size corresponding to their correlation. I have the infrastructure coded into the app (commented out), but alas, my knowledge of D3 and manipulating SVG's are lacking at the time of this writing.
